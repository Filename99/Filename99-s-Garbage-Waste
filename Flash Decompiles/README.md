This is a folder for decompiles of Flash animations, games and other stuff.

> Short for Adobe Flash, Flash is software that allows users to create animated works that are saved as .FLV and can be viewed over the Internet. It was originally developed by FutureWave and known as Future Splash Animator. In 1996, it was renamed and introduced to the public as Macromedia Flash, shortly after Macromedia purchased the product. Later, Adobe announced plans to purchase Macromedia, which was finalized and completed by the end of 2005.

Here is the list of used animations and games made in Flash, decompiled here:
